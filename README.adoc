= Key Management App for LiveCD

This Docker application supports verios smartcard key management tools. It is intended to be
started from the PVZDLiveCD.


== Supported Smart Cards
There is out-of-the box support for cards, such as:

- OpenPGP card
- JavaCard with installed Muscle applet
- other PKI smartcarda supported by OpenSC

To install a proprieatary smart card driver create an image based on this one and include the
driver installation in the Dockerfile.

Commands use PKCS11_CARD_DRIVER to point to the card driver.
The default value is '/usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so'.

== Known Limitations

Plugging and unplugging readers and cards is not signalled to the application container. (This
would need and improved dbus integration with the container.)
